## Project Description

In this project, I decide to talk about the red and yellow cards in rugby because many people do not know how they work and even for myself, some of the positions in the field have more tendency to receive cards than the others. Using the information from The Six Nations competition. And look inside the Forwards, which is the position with more Cards? I think it should be the flanker or BR, the players in the 3ºrow who obtain more cards as they play in each move.


## Questions & Hypotheses

Which is the Team/Country with more yellow Cards?

Which Field Position of the players receive or have more Yellow/Red Cards?

In the Forward Position, is the 3º row the players with more cards?
