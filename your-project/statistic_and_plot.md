# Statistic Part: Rugby Analysis.

In this part, we are going to talk about the output seen in the respectives question I make about the yellow and red cards at rugby.

During the analysis, we have to take into account that all the data is from the Six Nations Tournaments where there are only 6 teams and a composition of 30 players by team.

First of all, I would like to explain the main points about the cards at Rugby, for the person who is going to read this small paper. The yellow card send you out of the field for 10 mins and then you can comeback to play with your teammates. If you receive 2 yellow cards in a same game, the accumulation of two yellow cards makes change them into a red ard which it expelse you from the match and receiveing a fine depending the way you obtained the red card, if by 2 yellow cards or a direct red card.


## Questions:

#### 1.Which Country has the most yellow cards?

As we can see, The country with more yellow cards is England with 54, follow by Scotland and Wales ( with 46 and 41). This is something strange because the winner of the last Six Nations is England, and receiving so many yellow cards, it means that more players were kick out from the field and more time without all the players. But if we have a look into the red cards, the country with more red cards is Italy with only 5, follow by England with 3. This number of red card could make sense for Italy with is the one with more lost matches of the six countries. However, England is follow by, which again makes non sense. Or at least we can say that the red cards and yellow do not really make a lot of differences in the matches and final results.


#### 2. Which FIeld Position has the highest number of Cards?

From this new graphic, we can observe that the forwards are the ones with more yellow cards and red cards because they are the rock of the team, the only ones that are taqueling all the time due to the fact they are the defence of the team, and they play the mele and the scrums, where there is more dirty plays than in the Back Position where they enter in contact 15 time per match as maximum.



#### 3. Is the 3ยบ row the one with more yellow cards?


During the analyse, I was thinking that, from the Forwards, the 3ยบ row is the one with more yellow cards becuase they are in all the playes. When they attack, they are the link between the forwards and the back. When they deffend, they are all the time deffending and reaching all the new attacks from the rival. This is why my hypothesis is that the 3ยบ row has the highest number of yellow cards.

The results we can see are that, the 3ยบ row is the BR position has only 38 yellow cards, with all the players of that position. This result is not the spected value because the PR, the number 1 and 3 of the field position.

The PR position receive 53 yellow cards which is an impacting result because the PR players are the slowest players and the fat players, which means they are not involve with all the plays and reach each defence quite late. Maybe the important fact is that those players , the 1 and 3 are in the first row of the mele and they may have the strongest contact against the others and they may not be the nicest players in the field.



#### 4. Is the scrum half the one with less yellow cards?

As the last wuestion, the back is the position with most contact of the ball and he is all the time playing the ball, so he does not have that much contact with the rivals. This must result in been the player with less yellow cards.

As we can see, the scrum half is the second position with most number of yellow cards. By having this result, the one with less yellows is the Full Back. This could be because he is the most faraway position in the field and has the lest contact with the opponents.
The player with more yellow cards are the full half and the wings with 19 yellow cards which do not really have a lot of contact against the other team.
